# **CA-JS1**
This project is my JavaScript 1 Course Assignment. This project builds on my previous work from the Rainy Days project, where I reused structure and styling as a starting point. 

## **Description** 
This application retrivies product data from a chosen API endpoint (Rainy Days). I reused parts of the structure and styling from Rainy Days assignment as a foundation. This application retrivies product data from the chosen API endpoint and displays it dynamically on the homepage. User can filter products, view detailed product- pages, add items to the basket, remove items, and complete the checkout process with a confirmation screen. 

The homepage icludes a homepage with a product list, a product detail page, a checkout page showing the basket, and a confirmation page displayed after the user completes the order. 

User can view all products on the homepage, filter products by gender, open a single product page, add items to the basket, remove them, view a summary on the checkout page, and see an order confirmation after completing the purchase. 

The project displays error messages when something goes wrong during API requests and shows loading indicator while data is being fetched. No hardcoded product data is used.
